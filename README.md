## 2. Abstract

This proposal presents a computer vision system developed for short-term forecasting of atmospheric conditions over Tashkent using real-time satellite imagery. The system integrates visible (VIS), infrared (IR), and water vapor (WV) channels to estimate cloud coverage, precipitation probability, and wind conditions for a specific local area.  
It aims to deliver forecasts at 15-minute intervals, achieving at least 90% accuracy for precipitation and cloud classification. The processed output will be visualized through an interactive dashboard displaying satellite overlays and forecasted weather data.

## 3. Problem & Motivation

Accurate and timely weather forecasting remains a challenge in developing regions such as Tashkent, where limited ground-based infrastructure reduces reliability.  
Traditional NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction) models offer global coverage but low spatial resolution and delay.  
This project seeks to bridge that gap by leveraging **Meteosat satellite data** and deep learning for **localized short-term nowcasting**.

## 4. Related Work

- CNNs and ConvLSTMs have proven effective in detecting cloud motion and precipitation from multispectral satellite imagery.  
- Studies using data from GOES and Himawari satellites have shown strong short-term forecasting performance.  
- However, many rely on large-scale computing clusters.  
Our project focuses on **lightweight ConvLSTM architectures** trained on **open-access Meteosat data**, providing an accessible approach for regional weather prediction.

## 5. Data & Resources

- **Primary Data:** Meteosat SEVIRI imagery (VIS, IR, WV) via EUMETSAT & Copernicus APIs  
- **Supporting Data:** OpenWeatherMap API, Meteostat API  
- **Format:** GeoTIFF / NetCDF ‚Üí image tensors  
- **Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Rasterio, Pandas  
- **Hardware:** Google Colab GPU / local GPU-enabled workstation

## 6. Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition:** Retrieve Meteosat SEVIRI imagery every 15 minutes.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Crop to Tashkent region, normalize, align channels.  
3. **Labeling:** Pair frames with weather labels (rain, wind, clouds).  
4. **Model:** CNN + ConvLSTM for spatiotemporal prediction.  
5. **Training:** Supervised learning with Adam optimizer.  
6. **Visualization:** Streamlit dashboard for real-time forecast display.
